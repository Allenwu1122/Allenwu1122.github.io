  I am currently pursuing a mechanical engineering degree at UCSD, with a specialization in controls and robotics. My passion lies in the future of robotics technology, and I am eager to contribute to this dynamic industry. To equip myself with the necessary skills, I am taking elective courses in autonomous vehicles, machine learning algorithms, data analysis, and robotics. These classes provide me with a strong engineering foundation and practical applications across various fields, preparing me to become a better engineer in the near future.

  Beyond the classroom, I have gained valuable experiences as a mechanical intern or engineer. These experiences have made me more innovative and thoughtful, helping me to refine my career path.

  In my spare time, I love to travel. Exploring new places and experiencing different cultures broadens my perspective and is something I deeply cherish.

  Recently, I took a gap quarter and completed military service in Taiwan. It was a memorable experience, completely different from the rest of my life. I hope this journey has prepared me to become a more mature individual and will continue to encourage me in the future.
